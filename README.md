Points noticed everyday-
1. from string s ---- int n= s.length() | if char c ----- int n= strlen(c);
2. return type should be same as function type --- int / long are differently used.

3.size of vector can be calculated by int n=a.size();

4.A 2D vector is a vector of vector. Like 2D arrays, we can declare and assign values to 2D matrix
   vector<vector<int> > vect={ { 1, 2, 3 }, 
                               { 4, 5, 6 }, 
                               { 7, 8, 9 } }; 
    for (int i = 0; i < vect.size(); i++) 
        for (int j = 0; j < vect[i].size(); j++) 
            cout << vect[i][j] << " "; 
        cout << endl;
Like Javaâ€™s jagged arrays, each row of 2D vector can contain different number of columns.
